        <h1>The mystry of our <span>World</span></h1>
        <p>
            The release of the first images from the James Webb space telescope, the most powerful ever launched into
            space, has renewed calls from astronomers for Nasa to rename the instrument amid allegations Webb was
            complicit in historical persecution of LGBTQ+ people.</p>
        <p>
            The $10bn telescope is named in tribute to James Webb, an American official who was the second administrator
            of Nasa. Webb led the space agency during many of the Apollo missions in the 1960s and also served as the US
            undersecretary of state from 1949 to 1952.</p>

        <p> The telescope's name has been criticised by many scientists amid allegations that Webb was linked to
            persecution of LGBTQ+ people in the 1950s and 1960s. The Lavender Scare witch-hunt resulted in the mass
            dismissal of gay and lesbian people from the US government service in the mid-20th century.
            Nasa leadership has stubbornly refused to acknowledge that what is now public info about JW's legacy means
            he does not merit having a great observatory named after him,” she added.</p>

        <P> During Webb's time as administrator, Nasa employee Clifford Norton was fired in 1963 for “immoral, indecent,
            and disgraceful conduct” after being interrogated on suspicion of homosexuality. Norton later successfully
            sued for wrongful dismissal.</P>

        <P> In September last year, Nasa announced it would not change the telescope's name. “We have found no evidence
            at this time that warrants changing the name of the James Webb space telescope,” Nasa's current
            administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement in September.</P>

        <P> In March, the journal Nature published 400 pages of internal Nasa documents obtained through a freedom of
            information request, including a white paper that said “Nasa had decided that removal of homosexual
            employees would be its policy. They had a choice during Webb's tenure as administrator to set or change that
            policy.”</P>

        <P> “A lot of astronomers are very unhappy the observatory is named after him,” wrote the American astronomer
            Phil Plait in his Bad Astronomy newsletter. “It's difficult to want to use an instrument when you know
            you'll have to write about it using the name of someone who worked to negate your very existence.”</P>

        <P> The observatory will produce amazing science and gorgeous images, certainly the equal of anything Hubble
            has done,” Plait tweeted. “But it's named after someone irrevocably tied to bigotry and homophobia, and
            moreover Nasa has botched the way they handled the situation.”</P>

        <P> … we have a small favour to ask. Millions are turning to the Guardian for open, independent, quality news
            every day, and readers in 180 countries around the world now support us financially.</P>

        <P> We believe everyone deserves access to information that's grounded in science and truth, and analysis rooted
            in authority and integrity. That's why we made a different choice: to keep our reporting open for all
            readers, regardless of where they live or what they can afford to pay. This means more people can be better
            informed, united, and inspired to take meaningful action.
